I am a PhD student in Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge.

In the past few years I have been working on General Relativity. More specifically I have been studying the mathematical properties of certain alternative theories of gravity.

Recently I became interested in Machine Learning and Neural Networks. (*More on this coming soon!*)

I also like [photography](http://giuseppe.papallo.it) and [cooking](https://instagram.com/greedyscholars)!

# About me

Hi, I'm **Giuseppe**, a Mathematical Physicist turned Software Engineer.

I am currently a *Senior Research Engineer* at
[Evolution AI](https://evolution.ai){:target="_blank"}, where we use modern Computer
Vision and NLP techniques to automatically extract information from PDFs and scanned
documents.
Here, I have been working on building complex web applications as well as some of the
Machine Learning models that power our solutions.
We also organize the [London Machine Learning Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/London-Machine-Learning-Meetup/){:target="_blank"}.

Before becoming a Software Engineer, I completed a PhD in General Relativity at the
University of Cambridge. You can find more details about my research [here](/academic).

### Open source projects

I enjoy writing software and occasionally take on small side projects outside of work.
You can find most of them on my [GitHub](https://github.com/giuppep) profile:

- [`rstr`](https://github.com/giuppep/rstr): a simple content-addressable blob-store written in Rust
with a [Python client](https://github.com/giuppep/rstr-client).
- [`flask-pg-session`](https://github.com/giuppep/flask-pg-session): a `Flask` extension
that implements server-side session support using `PostgreSQL` as a backend.

## Beyond work


### Music

I love music! I play guitar, cavaquinho and a few Brazilian percussion instruments.

I have a deep interest in Brazilian traditional music and I am part of a few percussion groups.
I had the priviledge of playing [*alfaia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfaia) for the
[*Nação de Maracatu Porto Rico*](https://nacaoportorico.maracatu.org.br/) in the official parade
of Recife's Carnival in 2023 and for [*Baque de Axé*](https://www.baquedeaxe.com/) in
Notting Hill Carnival in 2019.


### Photography

Photography is one of my passions. I mostly focus on documentary-style phography and I
particularly enjoy working with analog methods.
During my time at Cambridge, I also worked as a freelancer photographer for a couple of
societies.

You can see some of my work in my [portfolio](https://giuseppe.papallo.it).

### Cooking

I am a keen cook and love experimenting in the kitchen as well as learning about
food-related traditions and techniques from all over the world.
I am particularly interested in fermented foods.

Back in uni I used to run [@greedyscholars](https://www.instagram.com/greedyscholars/)
with my friend [Bruno](https://brloureiro.github.io/) where we posted pictures of our
culinary creations.

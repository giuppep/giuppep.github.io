I recently completed my PhD in the General Relativity group at [DAMTP, University of Cambridge](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/), with the thesis
[*Causality and the initial value problem in Modified Gravity*](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/277416).

## research

<div class="collapsed" markdown="1">
Einstein's theory of General Relativity provides a simple, elegant and accurate description of the large scale structure of our Universe.
Despite its many successes, this theory does not provide satisfactory theoretical explanations for certain phenomena (e.g. dark energy, singularities...).
Many *Modified Gravity* theories have been proposed in order to account for these problems.
While the physical implications of such models have received much attention, the study of their mathematical consistency has been neglected.

In my PhD research I studied the mathematical properties of two classes of Modified Gravity theories, namely *Lovelock* and *Horndeski theories*. The main objective was to determine whether they satisfy some fundamental consistency requirements such as *causality* and *well-posedness of the initial value problem*.

Our results suggest that these theories may *not* admit a well-posed initial value problem, implying that they may not constitute a viable alternative to Einstein's theory.

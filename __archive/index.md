I am a Research Engineer at [Evolution AI](https://evolution.ai){:target="_blank"}!

In the past few years I have been working on General Relativity. More specifically I have been studying the mathematical properties of certain alternative theories of gravity.

I recently completed my PhD at DAMTP, University of Cambridge with the thesis [*Causality and the initial value problem in Modified Gravity*](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/277416){:target="_blank"}.

I also like [photography](http://giuseppe.papallo.it){:target="_blank"} and [cooking](https://instagram.com/greedyscholars){:target="_blank"}!
